# Restreamer-Dashboard
A visual dashboard to control OBS from another location.

## About
restreamer-dashboard is a custom UI built on Node-Red to control many functions of OBS, without actually connecting to the host's computer. This is aimed at speedrunning marathons, therefore most of the functions one might use are included, such as scene-switching, audio management and more. Unlike Teamviewer, the never has access to the host's computer, and this can even be ran off a webserver!

### Features
- 25 pre-built scenes, with an additional 5 customizable ones
- 6 pre-built audio sources, with an additional 3 customizable ones
- Full audio management, including individual volume sliders and mute controls
- Fully functional preview and program, powered by [OBS.Ninja](https://obs.ninja/)
- Auto Record: Record whenever you're not in an intermission
- Full monitoring tab with all OBS stats and Twitch feed
- Password-protected controls including start/stop streaming and recording
- NodeCG integration including timer and run control
- Support for HTTPS and password authentication

## Using The Dashboard
The UI makes the dashboard super simple to use! All functions are neatly sorted into different pages, accessible by using the menu on the top-left.
To switch a scene, it's as simple as selecting the layout, entering the runner's Twitch name, and pressing the transition button. With NodeCG integration, controlling the timer and run information is a breeze. 

There are 25 pre-built layouts available, plus 5 customizable buttons in the scene panel for those unusual game layouts. Same goes for audio, with 6 pre-built audio controls, plus 3 additional customizable audio controls if you ever need to add an audio source.

It also comes with a OBS scene collection that you can use, but you are welcome to make your own!
